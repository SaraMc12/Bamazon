# bamazon

In this app I created a site to showcase merchandise for users to purchase online. This is someting no one has ever done before obvously. Why I am not a milionare yet is beyond me. 

##cute but what is the point of this?

the point beyond the fact that this is a homework assignment is to create a database that keeps track of 
the websites stock and can inform the user if the quantity requested is insufficiant.

## what tools are used to create this

1. MySQL
2. Node

## how to use it

1. in the terminal type node bamazonCustomer.js
    below you will see a table of products


2. once you are able to view the table choose an item
    like some clown shoes for example:

3. the terminal will prompt the user 
by asking for an ID number. In this case it is #1

4. The terminal will then prompt the user as to how many items they want to purchse
Considering how many clowns are in this bootcamp lets get a bunch. How about 6?

5. In this case my company only carreis a few clown shoes 5 to be exact and so we dont have enough
    Luckily, my website is smart enough to know this and lets the customer know that the order cannot
    be processed.
